# BlankBot

At a time when I was using Discord heavily during COVID lockdown, I wanted to create a bot for my server or to just mess around. 
Also wanted to learn NodeJS, MongoDB and anything else I can so I was up for any challange. 
Still work in progress, haven't had much time to put into it, but its a good start.
